// first C++ program

#include <iostream>
// # = prerocessor directive
// inluclude = add directives of a given library = iostram library
// <stream> = look in the current directory first, then look in the
// directory where the standard libraries are kept
// "" = look in the current directory first, then look in the directory
//where the standard libraries are kept
// basically changing <> to "" = it can make a difference
// <> - goes straight to the standard directory
// "" - goes to the current directory first and only then to the standard

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
    return 0;
}
